I am a postdoc researcher at Università degli Studi di Milano (Italy), in the group of [Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/).
Previously, I completed my PhD under the supervision on [Olivier Cappé](https://www.di.ens.fr/olivier.cappe/) and [Aurélien Garivier](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/aurelien.garivier/www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/_agarivie/index.html).
My research interests are mainly centered on sequential decision problems, including online learning, bandits and their extensions. 
During my PhD, I have mainly studied applications of bandit theory to online markets. Currently, as a part of [ELSA](https://www.elsa-ai.eu/),
I am investigating forms of online federated learning. 
I am eager to work on more robust, sustainable sequential decision algorithms, either in a federated setting or not.
