### Syllabus
These classes are intended to help acquire a technical toolbox for Machine Learning and Deep Learning for example.
They explain what happens under the hood when applying certain Machine Learning algorithms that rely on numerical optimization.
- A short introduction to Neural Networks
- Linear Least Squares: a method relying on Cholesky's decomposition / on the QR decomposition
- The one dimensional Newton method for equation solving and minimization
- Solving equations of multiple variables with the Newton methods
- Unconstrained Optimization in $\mathbb R^d$ with the Newton method and gradient descent
- Constrained Optimization
- Automated Differentiation
