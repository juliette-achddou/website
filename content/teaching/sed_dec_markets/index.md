### Syllabus

- The online learning framework\: introduction and motivation
- Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL)
- Experts and bandits\: Hedge and Exp3
- The UCB algorithm for stochastic bandits
- An introduction to online markets\: overview of possible applications
- Online posted price auctions (ideas from [Kleinberg, Leighton, 2003])
- Second price auctions from the point of view of the buyer (ideas from [Weed, Perchet, Rigollet, 2016])
